# Open Weather #

## Description ##
For this project I wanted to create an quick and easy to use weather site using an Open WeatherMap API. 
The user will get results back about the current weather they are searching for and a five day forecast.

## Installation ##
The user can simply click the link below in order to use the application.
If the user would like to contribute to the project the user can clone the SSH into their own folder in the terminal.

## Usage ## 
The site is meant to be easy and simple to use. 
The user can type in the city they wish to see the current and five day weather forecast of.
The results will pop up on the same screen moments later. 
The cities the user searches for will be saved into a section of pervious searches where the user can click on the cities in the previous search bar to see the weather again without typing the city into the searach bar.
